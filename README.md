# Martingale

Hello gambler, you are playing roulette Martingale.

Rules are simple, you change colors when you win, you double down if you lose.

Get rich or get rekt trying, can you beat the odds ?

## Development setup
#### Virtualenv
You may want to setup and activate a virtual environment for the project using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

- Get `virtualenv` for Python3 using `sudo pip3 install virtualenv `
- Setup virtual environment using `virtualenv --python=$(which python3) env`
- Activate virtual environment using `source env/bin/activate`

#### Install dependencies
The list of Python is in `requirements.txt`. You can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside your virtual environment (if you're using one -- which you should be).

#### Run project
You can run the project using `python main.py`.

#### Tests
Coming soon ;)
